Welcome to my bubble sort folder. In this folder, you will find various implementations of a bubble sort. 
A bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. A bubble sort repeatedly compares and swaps adjustcent elements if they are in the wrong order. 
A bubble sort algorithm repeats these comparisons until the entire list is sorted. 
With each iteration of the inner loop of a bubble sort, the largest (or smallest) element left in the unsorted portion of the list is moved to the end.
